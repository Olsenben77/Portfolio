          Hi! My name is Benjamin Olsen, a full time teacher and native of snowy
          Wisconsin. In my spare time I enjoy wrestling bears, watching the
          Packers face the bears, and drinking bear I mean "beer." I graduated
          with an education and Spanish degree in 2017, and have been teaching
          high school Spanish ever since. I most recently moved to Washington
          this past June and have enjoyed my time here, even through the rainy
          weather. My friends and I have had opportunities to explore Mt.
          Rainier, downtown Seattle, and the surrounding area night life. There
          is a lot more to see, mainly restaurants, that I want to see and am
          excited to make this new place my home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not have past experience coding but do have many friends and
          colleagues who have gotten into the profession. One close friend even
          took a similar boot camp and is now coding a website with his father.
          My hope is that this class will be able to open new career paths and
          strengthen my skills as a learner and professional.
